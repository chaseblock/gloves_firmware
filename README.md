NRF52832 Firmware for Force Sensor Measurement
==============================================

This repository contains the firmware code for periodically measuring several ADC channels and an IMU from a NRF52832 microcontroller. It was made for CS598EKS (Illinois' Smart Cities / IoT course).

To run this, set up [nRF Connect for VS Code](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-VS-Code) and compile using that. To program, either use a nRF development board and the Connect SDK's default tools, or use something like [openocd](https://openocd.org/).
